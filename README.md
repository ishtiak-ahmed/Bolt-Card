## Project Description
```This is an Admin dashboard app for a Imaginary  Bank (Credit Card) service. Here I use Redux(Thunk), React. I implemented the case insensitive search function with redux. I used The SASS module system to make it fully responsive with raw CSS rules. I also used the  Material Icon library to use icons. I built this layout as it was in a mockup.```
